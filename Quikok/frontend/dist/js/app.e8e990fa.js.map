淑均，曉暢軍事，試用於昔日，先帝稱之曰「能」，是以眾議 舉寵為督。愚以為營中之事，悉以咨之，必能使行陣和睦，優 劣得所。親賢臣，遠小人，此先漢所以興隆也；親小人，遠賢 臣，此後漢所以傾頹也。先帝在時，每與臣論此事，未嘗不歎 息痛恨於桓、靈也。侍中、尚書、長史；參軍，此悉貞良死節 之臣也，願陛下親之信之，則漢室之隆，可計日而待也。</p>\n            <p

足，當獎率三軍，北定中原，庶竭駑鈍，攘除奸凶，興復漢室 ，還於舊都；此臣所以報先帝而忠陛下之職分也。至於斟酌損 益，進盡忠言，則攸之、褘、允之任也。</p>\n            <p class=\"py-2\">願陛下託臣以討賊興復之效；不效，則治臣之罪，以告先 帝之靈。若無興德之言，則戮允等，以彰其慢。陛下亦宜自課， 以諮諏善道，察納雅言，深追先帝遺詔，臣不勝受恩感激。
