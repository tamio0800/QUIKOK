everybody thinks that's very impressive and asked me to congratulate you.\n            they want to speak to you in person, if possible, to give you their regards.\n            they also said they will tell our distant relatives in christmas supper and in NYE they will ignite fireworks that spell your name.\n            i also told about this enormous deed to closer relatives, they had the same reaction. they asked for your address so they can send congratulatory cards and messages.\n            my friends didn't believe me when i told them i knew the author of this gigantic feat, really, they were dumbstruck, they said they will make your name echo through years and years to come.\n            when my neighbour found out about what you did, he was completely dumbstruck too, he wanted to know who you are and he asked (if you have the time, of course) if you could stop by to receive gifts, congratulations and handshakes.\n            with the spreading of the news, a powerful businessman of the area decided to hire you as the CEO of his company because of this tremendous feat and at the same time an important international shareholder wants to sponsor you to give speeches\n            and teach everybody how to do as you did so the world becomes a better place. you have become famous not only here but also everywhere, everybody knows who you are. the news spread really fast and mayors of all cities are setting up\n            porticos, ballons, colossal boom speakers, anything that can make your name stand out more and see which city can congratulate you the hardest for this magnificent feat.</p>\n            <v-btn\n              color=\"general\"\n              round\n              class=\"font-weight-light\"\n            >Follow</v-btn>\n

劣得所。親賢臣，遠小人，此先漢所以興隆也；親小人，遠賢 臣，此後漢所以傾頹也。先帝在時，每與臣論此事，未嘗不歎 息痛恨於桓、靈也。侍中、尚書、長史；參軍，此悉貞良死節 之臣也，願陛下親之信之，則漢室之隆，可計日而待也。</p>\n            <p class=\"py-2\">臣本布衣，躬耕於南陽，苟全性命於亂世，不求聞達於諸 侯。先帝不以臣卑鄙，猥自枉屈，三顧臣於草廬之中，諮臣以 當世之事，由是感激，遂許先帝以驅馳。後值傾覆，受任於敗 軍之際，奉命於危難之間，爾來二十有一年矣！先帝知臣謹慎 ，故臨崩寄臣以大事也。受命以來，夙夜憂勤，恐託付不效， 以傷先帝之明。故五月渡瀘，深入不毛。今南方已定，兵甲已 足，當獎率三軍，北定中原，庶竭駑鈍，攘除奸凶，興復漢室 ，還於舊都；此臣所以報先帝而忠陛下之職分也。至於斟酌損 益，進盡忠言，則攸之、褘、允之任也。</p>\n

失義，以塞忠諫之路也。宮中府中，俱為一體，陟罰臧否，不 宜異同。若有作姦犯科，及為忠善者，宜付有司，論其刑賞， 以昭陛下平明之治，不宜篇私，使內外異法也。</p>\n            <p class=\"py-2\">侍中、侍郎郭攸之、費褘、董允等，此皆良實，志慮忠純 ，是以先帝簡拔以遺陛下。愚以為宮中之事，事無大小，悉以 咨之，然後施行，必能裨補闕漏，有所廣益。將軍向寵，性行 淑均，曉暢軍事，試用於昔日，先帝稱之曰「能」，是以眾議 舉寵為督。愚以為營中之事，悉以咨之，必能使行陣和睦，優 劣得所。親賢臣，遠小人，此先漢所以興隆也；親小人，遠賢 臣，此後漢所以傾頹也。先帝在時，每與臣論此事，未嘗不歎 息痛恨於桓、靈也。侍中、尚書、長史；參軍，此悉貞良死節 之臣也，願陛下親之信之，則漢室之隆，可計日而待也。</p>\n            <p class=\"py-2\">臣本布衣，躬耕於南陽，苟全性命於亂世，不求聞達於諸 侯。先帝不以臣卑鄙，猥自枉屈，三顧臣於草廬之中，諮臣以 當世之事，由是感激，遂許先帝以驅馳。後值傾覆，受任於敗 軍之際，奉命於危難之間，爾來二十有一年矣！先帝知臣謹慎 ，故臨崩寄臣以大事也。受命以來，夙夜憂勤，恐託付不效， 以傷先帝之明。故五月渡瀘，深入不毛。今南方已定，兵甲已 足，當獎率三軍，北定中原，庶竭駑鈍，攘除奸凶，興復漢室 ，還於舊都；此臣所以報先帝而忠陛下之職分也。至於斟酌損 益，進盡忠言，則攸之、褘、允之任也。</p>\n            <p class=\"py-2\">願陛下託臣以討賊興復之效；不效，則治臣之罪，以告先 帝之靈。若無興德之言，則戮允等，以彰其慢。陛下亦宜自課， 以諮諏善道，察納雅言，深追先帝遺詔，臣不勝受恩感激。
