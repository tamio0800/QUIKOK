劣得所。親賢臣，遠小人，此先漢所以興隆也；親小人，遠賢 臣，此後漢所以傾頹也。先帝在時，每與臣論此事，未嘗不歎 息痛恨於桓、靈也。侍中、尚書、長史；參軍，此悉貞良死節 之臣也，願陛下親之信之，則漢室之隆，可計日而待也。</p>\n            <p class=\"py-2\">臣本布衣，躬耕於南陽，苟全性命於亂世，不求聞達於諸 侯。先帝不以臣卑鄙，猥自枉屈，三顧臣於草廬之中，諮臣以 當世之事，由是感激，遂許先帝以驅馳。後值傾覆，受任於敗 軍之際，奉命於危難之間，爾來二十有一年矣！先帝知臣謹慎 ，故臨崩寄臣以大事也。受命以來，夙夜憂勤，恐託付不效， 以傷先帝之明。故五月渡瀘，深入不毛。今南方已定，兵甲已 足，當獎率三軍，北定中原，庶竭駑鈍，攘除奸凶，興復漢室 ，還於舊都；此臣所以報先帝而忠陛下之職分也。至於斟酌損 益，進盡忠言，則攸之、褘、允之任也。</p>\n            <p class=\"py-2\">願陛下託臣以討賊興復之效；不效，則治臣之罪，以告先 帝之靈。若無興德之言，則戮允等，以彰其慢。陛下亦宜自課， 以諮諏善道，察納雅言，深追先帝遺詔，臣不勝受恩感激。 今當遠離，臨表涕泣，不知所云。</p>\n          </div>\n          <!-- <v-btn\n

以傷先帝之明。故五月渡瀘，深入不毛。今南方已定，兵甲已 足，當獎率三軍，北定中原，庶竭駑鈍，攘除奸凶，興復漢室 ，還於舊都；此臣所以報先帝而忠陛下之職分也。至於斟酌損 益，進盡忠言，則攸之、褘、允之任也。</p>\n            <p class=\"py-2\">願陛下託臣以討賊興復之效；不效，則治臣之罪，以告先 帝之靈。若無興德之言，則戮允等，以彰其慢。陛下亦宜自課，
